							In July 2020, 6 students from the University of Bristol will travel to <a class="link" href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/70%C2%B050'54.8%22N+25%C2%B039'38.1%22W">Milne Land</a>, North East Greenland, as part of the Expeditions Society's Diamond Anniversary Expedition. At 71 degrees North, Milne Land sits entirely within the Arctic circle. Its granite summits rise directly from the surrounding fjords and glaciers within, many of which at altitudes of 1000-2000m remain untouched. The aim of the expedition  is to attempt a number of alpine and rock first ascents of the peaks in the area around and North East of Korridoren glacier.<br/><br/>
							The team will comprise of 3 male and 3 female mountaineers, with a mix of alpine and rock experience. Noteably, every team member must have the experience to join the <a class="link" href="http://www.alpine-club.org.uk/ac2/documents/AC_membership_leaflet.pdf">Alpine Club</a> as an aspirant member by 31 August 2019. The team will cross Korridoren to a base camp at which it will split into two halves; with a climbing team aiming to put up a new major route and an alpine team aiming to achieve a number of first ascents of summits in the extended area via several multi-day expeditions from base camp.<br/><br/>
							Subject to sponsorship, a number of training trips will run throughout the year to ensure that the team is well-equipped to deal with an alpine expedition to the Arctic. At a bare minimum, there will be a specific team training programme during the annual Scotland trip over new year and an week in the Alps in summer 2020.<br/><br/>
							Expeditions to North East Greenland have huge logistical and insurance costs and the price of putting a person on the ground for 2 weeks is around £6000. There are a number of grants, between 10-20, aimed at young exploratory expeditions than can be accessed. Nevertheless, the expected personal contribution is no less than £2000 per person, which will be split into more manageable installments throughout the academic year.<br/><br/>
							Whether or not the teams are successful in their summit attempts, the expedition will be an impressive feat, not just in University of Bristol mountaineering, but in young British exploratory mountaineering. Successfully documenting in words and pictures will allow UBES' Diamond Anniversary Expedition to pioneer expeditions to the area by teams from all over the world.

										Danai Osmond is leader of the UBES Diamond Anniversary Expedition. Having spent two years as an Officer in the British Army after leaving school, he is now studying for his undergraduate degree in Geology at the University of Bristol. Never living in a country for more than a year during his childhood, exploration has become ingrained in Danai’s nature and often on weekends in secondary school, he would hop on the train to scale the peaks and ridges of the Brecon Beacons and Snowdonia by himself. Having spent part of two summers in the Alps, Danai is spending a full season in Saas Grund this summer with various meets to cement his application to become a full member of the Alpine Club. It is no surprise that Danai will be with the alpine team in pursuit of more incredible ridges. That said, Danai has racked up over 50 leads of up to E1 trad and 6c sport, cursing at Avon limestone for the vast majority. Danai is also a landscape and adventure photographer, having owned a DSLR since his first days in the mountains; he is particularly looking forward to the multi-day boat trip through the iceberg-laden Scoresby Sound and sunrise views from summits.

										Daniel Heins, a master’s student studying hydrology at the University of Bristol, is a climber, caver and leader of our expedition climbing team. Originally from New York, he has called many places home, including Chicago, Tennessee, South Dakota, and Bristol. His childhood obsession with studying and exploring rocks and landscapes has pushed him to both study geoscience and pursue climbing and caving. Over the past five years, he has climbed across the UK and US, with roughly 500 leads, onsighting up to E3/5.11- trad and 5.12a sport. His favourite areas tend to be full of adventurous climbs on striking granite formations, namely the bold spires of the Needles of Custer State Park/Mt Rushmore and on the soaring peaks and domes in the High Sierra. When not climbing up rocks above ground, he is exploring caves below, having over the past four years spent hundreds of hours mapping the edges of Mammoth and Jewel Caves, spending up to four days underground at a time. In July, he will be joining the Cambridge Caving Club on their expedition to discover new cave passage in the complex vertical systems of the Loser plateau in the Austrian alps.
