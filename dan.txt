										Daniel Heins, a master’s student studying hydrology at the University of Bristol, is a climber, caver and leader of our expedition climbing team. Originally from New York, he has called many places home, including Chicago, Tennessee, South Dakota, and Bristol. His childhood obsession with studying and exploring rocks and landscapes has pushed him to both study geoscience and pursue climbing and caving. Over the past five years, he has climbed across the UK and US, with roughly 500 leads, onsighting up to E3/5.11- trad and 5.12a sport. His favourite areas tend to be full of adventurous climbs on striking granite formations, namely the bold spires of the Needles of Custer State Park/Mt Rushmore and on the soaring peaks and domes in the High Sierra. When not climbing up rocks above ground, he is exploring caves below, having over the past four years spent hundreds of hours mapping the edges of Mammoth and Jewel Caves, spending up to four days underground at a time. In July, he will be joining the Cambridge Caving Club on their expedition to discover new cave passage in the complex vertical systems of the Loser plateau in the Austrian alps.
